# Time command execution. sys+user is the total amount of CPU time, 
# and real is the elapsed (wall clock) time.
time sleep 5
time find . | wc -l
# Second iteration should be faster due to filesystem caching
time find . | wc -l

# Find out which version of a command is being used when you
# execute that command in your shell
time ls
which time
$(which time) ls

# HANG ON! which time said I was using one time command, but when
# I invoke it directly it doesn't give the same output. In this case
# time is not actually finding that command, see:
type time

# time is a shell builtin, and the which command gave misleading 
# information. The shell builtin time just provides information about
# timing. sys+user is the total amount of CPU time, and real is the
# elapsed (wall clock) time. The /usr/bin/time command will also
# provide memory usage statistics.

# Find the type of a file
file pizza.cfg 
file solar.pdf


# How much space are my files using?

# No command line argument, uses . by default
du -shc

# Can specify a directory/file
du -shc data

# Report each one separately if they are specified separately
du -shc data/*
# To see what the command is doing, put echo in front
echo du -shc data/*

# Similar information using ls
ls -lSrh data/*

# Different if there are directories being listed
du -shc writing/*
ls -lSrh writing/*

# Note in the case of ls it reports the size of the directory 
# structure, which is related to the number of files it contains
# not the size of the files inside it

# Sort by size when using du (using -h option to sort the human 
# readable sizes properly
du -shc data/* | sort -h

# How many files do I have in each directory (useful to know when
# your inode quota is exhausted on NCI systems)
for d in *; do echo -n $(find $d | wc -l); echo " $d"; done > log
sort -h log

# In an unfamiliar system it can sometimes help to know what
# filesystems are available
df -h


# Permissions

# Take away group read permissions
ls -l pizza.cfg
chmod g-r pizza.cfg
ls -l pizza.cfg

# Do the same recursively for a directory
mkdir tmp
chmod -R g-r tmp
ls -l tmp

# A directory must be executable to be able to cd into it
chmod a-x tmp
set +e
cd tmp
set -e

# Get some strange behaviour when you try to list a directory
# for which you do not have execute permissions
ls -l tmp

# Examine the permissions of a directory without listing contents
ls -ld tmp
chmod a+x tmp
ls -ld tmp

# Change the group of a file/directory
touch tmp/file1 tmp/file2 tmp/file3
chgrp hh5 tmp/file1
ls -l tmp
# Recursively: sets same permissions on all files and directories 
# contained under named directory
chgrp -R hh5 tmp
ls -l tmp

# What group would be assigned to a new file in this directory 
touch tmp/newfile
ls -l tmp/newfile
# Can make it so any new files inherit the group of the directory
# (this is called setgid)
chmod g+s tmp
touch tmp/evennewerfile
ls -l tmp/evennewerfile

# Very useful for modellers who might switch the group they submit
# their model runs with on PBS, but wish to always save them as one
# group that maybe has a large disk quota

# If you wish to give read and access permissions to a directory
# tree you must give read permissions on ordinary files, but read
# and execute permissions for any directories. If you simply did
# this:
# chmod -R o+rx directory_name
# it would make everything executable for others. Instead we use 
# the special X flag, which will only make files/directories 
# executable if the executable flag is already set for some other 
# user. So the correct way is
chmod -R o+rX tmp


# Change who owns a file (chown). Can't be done on raijin for security
# reasons. Be careful you do not create a file you cannot delete. 
# Contact help@nci if you need to change file ownership. 

# Access Control Lists (ACLs) are a fine-grained permissions scheme

# To see ACLs on a file
getfacl log

# Set read access to all members of hh5
setfacl -m g:hh5:r log
getfacl log

# Can use ACLs to allow collaboration between users in a shared 
# directory 
mkdir shared
# Give collaborator (you123) write permissions to the directory
set +e
setfacl -R -m u:you123:rwX shared      
# Make sure collaborator can read new files
setfacl -R -d -m u:you123:rwX shared   
# Make sure owner (me1234) can read new files created by collaborator
setfacl -R -d -m u:me1234:rwX shared   
set -e

# Shortcuts

# Can make a link (shortcut) to a file or directory

# Link can be symbolic
ln -s north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/goostats statslink
ls -l
rm statslink

# Or "hard". Note the difference between statslink in the
# two directory listings
ln north-pacific-gyre/2012-07-03/goostats statslink
ls -l
rm statslink


# HPC Software

# Most software is accessed using the module command
module load pbs
module show pbs
module unload pbs
